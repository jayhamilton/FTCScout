# FTCScout
Simple application that allows the team members to record scout information. It consists of a list view with 3 pieces of summary information (Team Name, Team Id and Ranking) from a team record object. The list defaults to being sorted by ranking. A search field allows you to search for a team in the list. Clicking on any item in the list brings up its details for editing. Clicking on the Add Team button allows you to add a new team entry.
